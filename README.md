Docusaurus Site for testing Cloudflare Pages Beta

This is a standard docusaurus v2 site, generated following the instructions here: https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/

If we were building this for GitHub pages, we would need to configure GitHub actions for the build, and add a gh-pages branch.

This Cloud Flare pages, the onboarding is really slick and there is no extra configuration needed! We can log into CloudFlare, and point it at this repo, and it will automatically build and publish the pages. Here is the running site: https://docs-r2uk.pages.dev/
